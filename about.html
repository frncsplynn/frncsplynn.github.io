      <p> I started traveling in 2013. Most of my travels are family travels. El Nido, Palawan was my first travel destination and it really captivated my heart. Before, my goal was to travel around the globe but I have realized that my own country has a lot of things to offer, so why not take the opportunity and enjoy your homeland first? That's when my awesome travel journey started. I am thankful that I decided to conquer the beauty of my own country first. It was very nostalgic and indeed a one of a kind experience.
