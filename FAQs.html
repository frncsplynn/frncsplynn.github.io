        <p>No it won't take you that much and it doesn't need to take you that much. Enjoyment doesn't depend on the amount you spend. At some point, it does affect, but you can always travel and enjoy even if you are on a tight budget. I suggest you guys to bring snacks and chips in order to save money. Based on experience, items sold on tourist destinations are way higher in price compared to a local supermarket or grocery. Also, plan ahead of time and spend up. Just be ready and bring extra money. I have learned on all my travels that you should bring exact amount. There will be instances when your planned or projected expense will change along the way. Travel while you can and savour every moment with your loved ones. Live life!</p>

        <p>It's because of my charm! Hahaha! Kidding, aside. I think it is because I always communicate with them. There should be a strong line of communication. I must say that my parents are very supportive with my travel journey. I don't do travels when I am busy with school stuff, so I make sure to really give my best and then I try to ask them after if I can schedule an escapade for this specific date during the vacation. Do not force your parents if they will not allow you to travel. Maybe there are certain reasons. Understand them and maybe in time, you'll be able to do so.Travelling doesn't need to be somewhere far. Look around you, feel the beauty of the nature, appreciate everything that surrounds and that will allow you to go through places only you are capable of going.</p>

        <p>I suggest you to bring light gears and waterproof ones. I have been using Go pro Hero 6 and I must say that it has been a good help in capturing not just underwater sceneries. Also, I don't recommend using DSLR especially when you will be going through a rough journey or road towards your destination.If possible, bring compact cameras. Mirrorless cameras are great investments and perform the same fuction as much as a DSLR camera does. You can always use your phone. It is not necessary to use high-end cameras or technologies. Just be sure to take good care of these gadgets especially in water activities and do not leave them unattended. Always take full responsibility of your belongings</p>
