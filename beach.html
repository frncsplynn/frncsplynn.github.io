        <p>Camarines Norte is a prime tourist destination because it offers a lot to visitors, whether they want to laze on the beach or ride the waves. One of the must-visit places of the region is Calaguas. Due to its rising popularity, it is experiencing an uptick in visitors and growth in commerce. It is a good place to visit because of its fine, white-sand beach, cerulean waters and great overlooking views.
          <br>
          <br>
          Swim in the turquoise waters or simply laze on the beach while in Calaguas. The sand is fine and the water is calm enough for wading in or simply dousing the heat of summer.
You can also play beach volleyball or Ultimate Frisbee.
Go on a short trek up the hill to get an overlooking view of the cove.
The island is also one of the best places to see the sunset or sunrise because there are no obstructions to the view.

      <p>El Nido, Palawan</p>
    </div>
    <div class="second">
      <div class="second-text">
        <p>One great thing about El Nido is that most key attractions, especially the islands and beaches, are grouped into tour packages. The tours are also regulated and standardized. Boatmen and travel agencies must abide by the rules and guidelines that they set in order to provide a smoother and more consistent service to tourists. A price ceiling is in effect, which means tour operators cannot sell tours at rates higher than what has been set by the government.
          <br>
          <br>
The two most visited spots in El Nido are the Small Lagoon and Big Lagoon of Miniloc Island, both used to be part of Tour A, which covers Miniloc Island. For the longest time, Tour A was the most popular island tour, attracting more tourists than all the other three by a mile. In effect, these sites are prone to overcrowding. To address the problem, in November 2018, the local government split the two apart and reassigned Small Lagoon to Tour D.</p>

        <p>At first I didn’t understand why they just call this the Golden Sand, I mean almost all the beaches in Jomalig has golden sand, so why call this place like that?But man, it didn’t disappoint. It has a stunning sandbar with glistening golden sand and some tiny rock formations scattered all over the place. God is just so good in creating this unique beauty of nature.
          <br>
          <br>
          Another peaceful place with gold to white sand beach between two boulders of rocks.  We hiked the huge rocks and we were welcomed by this stunning view of the long stretch of white sand and the blue sea. Just spectacular!At first I didn’t understand why they just call this the Golden Sand, I mean almost all the beaches in Jomalig has golden sand, so why call this place like that?

      <p>Boracay, Aklan</p>
    </div>
    <div class="fourth">
      <div class="fourth-text">
        <p>Boracay has always been the flagship beach destination of the Philippines. It has topped many lists of the greatest beaches in the world, compiled by international travel magazines. All this lovin’ from local and foreign press and backpackers has been drawing swarms and swarms of tourists. What used to be an unspoiled sleepy village transformed into an overdeveloped party island. Even upscale hotels and restaurants have found their way to the island, attracting luxury travelers. Yet, it remains friendly to the budget-conscious.
          <br>
          <br>
          Like I always say, the one thing that I love about Boracay and what I think makes it so popular is the diversity of activities. Boracay will keep you busy, and there’s no running out of things to do. It has something for everyone.
