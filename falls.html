      <p>Tinuy-an Falls, Surigao del Sur</p>

      <div class="first-text">
        <p>Of all the falls we’ve visited, this is the real deal. With almost a hundred meters wide, Tinuy-An Falls has the crown for being the widest waterfall of the Philippines. This 3-tier, 55 meters high cascading waterfall can be found on Barangay Burboana, Bislig, Surigao del Sur. As the leading tourist spot of the city, it’s been frequently featured in travel magazines and videos.
          <br>
          <br>
          It’s no wonder why Tinuy-An Falls is the main tourist destination of Surigao del Sur. Its natural formation is one of a kind. Of all the falls we’ve visited so far, this is arguably the best in the country. Hate to join the dubbing of Tinuy-An as the “Niagara Falls of the Philippines”, as giving it that title deprives its very own identity and beauty (at least for us).
          <br>
          <br>
          If planning to go to Mindanao, make sure to add Tinuy-An Falls on your bucket list. It’s a must-visit destination for nature lovers and outdoor enthusiasts. Those who are already in their senior moments, no need to worry about trekking, as Tinuy-An Falls is just few walks away from the road.

      <p>Aliwagwag Falls, Davao Oriental</p>
    </div>
    <div class="second">
      <div class="second-text">
<p>Aliwagwag Falls is one of the most visited natural attractions in Davao Oriental. It is also considered as the country’s highest waterfalls. The falls, made up of more than 100 cascading waterfalls, is located just 30-40 minutes away from Cateel (pronounced as ka-ti-il). It is made up of rock formations varying in shapes and sizes. The current is strong; you will be treated with different drops at every level. Definitely a must-visit since it’s considered as one of the most beautiful falls in the Philippines, and we agree!
<br>
<br>
Aliwagwag Falls Eco Park is well maintained and designed. It doesn’t take away the beauty of the waterfalls. Walkways and the overall design is majorly made of wood which complements the waterfall’s charm.They have a trail going up along the left side of the falls. You may see and take photos of the different drops from different view decks along the trail. Remember to swim only at designated swimming areas as the waterfalls current is really powerful. Other possible activities are crossing the 45-meter Monkey bridge over Aliwagwag Falls and 680- meter Zipline across Cateel river. They also have designated eating areas, a public toilet, shower areas, food concessionaires and restaurants.

      <p> Kaparkan Falls, Abra</p>

      <div class="third-text">
        <p>Abra’s natural environment has engineered this incredible masterpiece right before my mind could ever imagine a waterfall that may look as grand as this. I found out that nature could surpass human creativity and imagination. Kaparkan Falls are alive and living. Mother Nature has shaped cascades of natural pools into the mountainside like water-filled rice terraces. Take a closer look around and you will see fallen trees and branches being swallowed up and converted into stone in our own lifetime. Kaparkan’s limestone terraces are continually evolving.
          <br>
          <br>
          Kaparkan’s multi-terraced limestone wonderland stretches for about 500 metres from top to bottom. Lounge in one of its crystal clear pools or climb Kaparkan’s staircase. The limestone edges of the pools look slippery but are actually very safe to walk along barefoot.

  Explore, enjoy and immerse yourself in the beauty and natural wonders of Kaparkan, but please do not vandalise, destroy or damage anything. This wonderland has been created slowly over millions of years.Seeing something in a photograph and seeing it in real life are completely different. Photographs will never be able to capture the full beauty of Nature. Photographs take a moment in time and freeze that moment forever.
