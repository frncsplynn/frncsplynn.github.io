        <p>Mount Pulag is the third-highest mountain in the Philippines, standing about 9587 ft above sea level. Locals call it the “playground of the gods.”

There are four trails to Mount Pulag: Ambangeg, Akiki and Tawangan trails are in Benguet and the Ambaguio trail is in Nueva Vizcaya. Most climbers choose the Ambangeg trail because it’s the easiest.

The easiest way to book a slot for Mount Pulag is through packaged tours. You can find a lot of packages in Google and Facebook.

        It was almost sunset when we saw a view of the sea of clouds, which is what Mount Pulag in the Philippines is famous for. We admired the view and set up our cameras. The rest of our friends caught up and we waited for a perfect sunset.

Note that mountain climbers who wish to climb Mount Pulag need to present a medical certificate and register at the DENR office in advance. There are various travel agencies organizing climbs to Mount Pulag via Ambangeg trail, for 2 days. The cost is about P4500 per person.

      <p>Northern Blossom Flower Farm, Atok</p>

        <p>The Northern Blossoms Flower Farm has recently been hyped by social media, which led to new opportunities for the locals here.  Homestays are starting to sprout, and locals are being trained as guides.  Other areas of Atok are slowly being discovered by tourists through tour packages offered by Brgy. Sayangan. I was lucky enough to visit the Northern Blossoms Flower Farm a few years back before it became popular.  But I never really got to blog about it. Recently, I had this urge to visit Benguet again, one of my favorite provinces in the Philippines. And I decided to start my exploration by traveling to the Northern Blossoms Flower Farm, which is blissfully located in Brgy.Sayangan in Atok, Benguet.

          At first sight, it may not look like the images you see in social media as there are flowers planted in their green house.  But try to explore around and you’ll find some Instagram-worthy spots. The flower farm is draped by pine-fringed mountains and vegetable farms.I also recommend doing the Circuit B tour at sunrise, which is being offered by Brgy.Sayangan tourism for a reasonable price (see below), so you’ll get to visit other tourist destinations in Atok. I’ve been to a couple of places in the country, and this part of Benguet remains one of the most beautiful I’ve seen.

        <p>Osmeña Peak, the highest mountain in Cebu is a cluster of green jagged hills like a deformed twin of Chocolate Hills of Bohol  hugging the shorelines of Badian.

This part of Dalaguete is reminiscent of Benguet. A serene town with low temperatures dotted with pine trees. A remote village inhabited mostly by vegetable farmers sporting their jackets, boots and jeans. And you will meet children eagerly helping their families in their farm work.  Here you’ll see vines crawling in trees and gardens, rooster cocking and cozy wood houses.

          At the jumping-off point to Osmeña Peak, hikers need to sign at the Osmeña Peak Tourism Center/ Hiker’s Center and pay  the Osmeña Peak entrance fee of PHP 30 per person.


Hike to Osmeña Peak summit from the jumping-off point is about 20-25 minutes only.  The hike is fairly easy, by far the easiest.

Osmeña Peak is usually foggy in the morning, so best to schedule your hike in the afternoon.  Osmeña Peak is also a good spot for sunset watching.
